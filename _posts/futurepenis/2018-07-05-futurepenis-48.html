<p id="caption">It was Maria who first suggested it, after a few drinks one night.  It wasn't technically illegal, though it was really socially frowned on.  I understood it, it was selfish to mate outside of the organized protocols.  Most people didn't have the option.  But it also felt unfair that I would spend most of my life without a child because I was one of the few who had a penis.  Maybe in the future we would change things to make it easier to move up in line but that wasn't going to happen for me.</p>
