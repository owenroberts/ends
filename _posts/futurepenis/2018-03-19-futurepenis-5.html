<p id="caption">Legally, penises don't have to wear clothes, but a lot of them do. Shopping for them is depressing though. I don't understand why their outfits don't have the cute slogans you see on baby clothes, like "Mama's little peanut." I guess it's because pensises don't grow out of them.</p>
