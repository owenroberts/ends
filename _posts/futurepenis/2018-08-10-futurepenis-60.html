<p id="caption">Not long after that my penis passed away.  He died peacefully.  I think he had a good life.  The doctors at the clinic told me he had contributed to over 1300 pregnancies during his life.  <br><br>  We had a small funeral.  I always thought it was kind of weird to have a funeral for a penis but it was kind of nice I guess.  I didn't bring my daughter.  I didn't really think she would understand.  They got along well, but she was still so young, she probably wouldn't remember him.</p>
