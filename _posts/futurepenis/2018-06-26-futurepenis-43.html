<p id="caption">We started getting a drink after picking up our little guys on Fridays.  I never had much occasion to drink before so it was fun.  We had good conversations, but they would eventually always end with the same subjectâ€”Our friends who had daughters. <br><br> It felt like the first hour or two we would try to talk about anything else, but eventually we would run out of things to talk about and then we would start talking about daughters and that could go on all night.  It was like torrential downpour that was waiting to break.</p>
