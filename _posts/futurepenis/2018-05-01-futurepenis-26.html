<p id="caption">It could have been another penis.  My little guy was nice and quiet.  The teacher I spoke to probably just didn't want to create tension.  But I was still anxious about it.  The teacher said it wasn't a big deal.  It was scary to imagine him out on the playground being pushed around.  It was even scarier to think of him pushing other little penises around.  I was anxious.  <br><br> I decided again that I had to say something. </p>
